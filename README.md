My first Machine Learning project! It centers around training a LSTM neural network with 
data from 2010-2018, then utilizes its knowledge to predict the stock price of Google
from 2018-2023. The code creates 4 layers of neural networks and drops 0.2 each layer
to prevent overfitting. 

In addition, I added MSFT to be predicted with the idea of moving towards predicting
the stock markets group, including any correlated stocks in the index.

This is what my current data produces for years 2018-2023, trained on 2010-2018 data!
